                <p>Ans: <span>when i use node js! Any project needs a programming environment and a runtime library that offers you basic programming tools/support and can compile and/or interpret your code. Nodejs is such as tool for the Javascript programming language. There are other similar tools for other languages such as Python, Java, PHP, C#, C++, Go, etc.. and when i need to use mongodb? ans:-If my application needs the ability to persistently store data in a way that you can efficiently query or update it later, then you would typically use some form of database.

They are used for OLAP systems.NoSQL database system consists of various kind of database technologies. These databases were developed in response to the demands presented for the development of the modern application.</span></p>

                <h6>Question 4.What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work?</h6>
                <p>Ans: <span>First we need to know that what is jwt? JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.
                    Once decoded, you will get two JSON strings:
                    The header and the payload.The signature. </span></p>
